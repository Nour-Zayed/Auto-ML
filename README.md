**Auto-ML: Automated Machine Learning with H2O, TPOT, and PyCaret 🚀**

📌 **Overview**

This repository demonstrates the power of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) by leveraging three powerful AutoML libraries: 
**H2O AutoML, TPOT, and PyCaret.**
These tools automate model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and pipeline optimization, making machine learning more efficient and accessible.

**📌 Why AutoML?**

✅ Saves time: Eliminates the need for manual model selection.

✅ Enhances performance: Finds the best model and fine-tunes it automatically.

✅ Accessible to all: Ideal for both beginners and experienced data scientists.


🔧 **Tools & Technologies**

**H2O AutoML:** Efficient and scalable AutoML framework for large datasets.

**TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool):** Uses genetic algorithms to optimize ML pipelines.

**PyCaret:** Simplifies ML workflows with an easy-to-use interface and automation.

**🎯 Features**

✔️ Automatic model selection: Finds the best-performing models with minimal manual effort.

✔️ Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizes model parameters automatically.

✔️ Pipeline automation: TPOT generates optimized pipelines for deployment.

✔️ Comparative analysis: Evaluates different AutoML frameworks on the same dataset.

🔍**1. H2O AutoML**

📌 **What it does:**

H2O AutoML automates the process of training and selecting the best machine learning models.

It trains multiple models, including Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Random Forest, Deep Learning, and Stacked Ensembles.

✅ **Key Benefits:**

✔ Scalability: Works efficiently on large datasets.

✔ Stacked Ensembles: Combines multiple models for better performance.

✔ Easy Integration: Works seamlessly with Python and R.

✔ Fast Processing: Runs models in parallel for quick execution.

📂 **In my Code:**

Uses the best model to predict on test data.

🧬**2. TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool)**

📌 **What it does:**

TPOT is a genetic algorithm-based AutoML tool that finds the best ML pipeline.

It automatically selects models, preprocessing steps, feature selection, and hyperparameters.

✅ **Key Benefits:**

✔ Automated Feature Engineering: Finds the best feature transformations.
