**Auto-ML: Automated Machine Learning with H2O, TPOT, and PyCaret 🚀**

📌 **Overview**

This repository demonstrates the power of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) by leveraging three powerful AutoML libraries: 
**H2O AutoML, TPOT, and PyCaret.**
These tools automate model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and pipeline optimization, making machine learning more efficient and accessible.

🔧 **Tools & Technologies**

**H2O AutoML:** Efficient and scalable AutoML framework for large datasets.
**TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool):** Uses genetic algorithms to optimize ML pipelines.
**PyCaret:** Simplifies ML workflows with an easy-to-use interface and automation.

**🎯 Features**

✔️ Automatic model selection: Finds the best-performing models with minimal manual effort.
✔️ Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizes model parameters automatically.
✔️ Pipeline automation: TPOT generates optimized pipelines for deployment.
✔️ Comparative analysis: Evaluates different AutoML frameworks on the same dataset.
